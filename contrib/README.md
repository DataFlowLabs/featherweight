External Contributions
================================================================================

Rather than include contributor's example code and reference designs inside of
the main `featherweight` repository, the list below is provided below to highlight
some public examples. Feel free to create a pull request for this list with your
own links.

Contributions such as bugfixes and tests to the main FTW library are
better suited as direct pull requests to the main repository rather than added
as an external contribution on this list. New features added and extensions to
the main library might be good candidates for inclusion into the main repository,
or they might be better suited as an external link here. If you are unsure, just
open an issue and we'll figure it out!

* Short description of the contribution. Is it an extension, an example, a
  reference design, or experimental code needing some feedback?
